**THIS IS NOT MY CREATION! I MADE SOME MiNOR CHANGES, BUT IT WAS MADE BY Frank L. Franco! ALL CREDIT GOES TO HIM!**

This is a calculator that tells you all the things you will need to know about your progress on the Valorant Battlepass. These calculations take your current tier, your teir, goal, and the time you have left to find statistics to reach your goal. The statistics it gives you are your remaining games, your remaining time, the games you need to play per day, and the hours you need to play per day (based off game length average). It gives you all of these for 3 gamemodes: Normal (Unrated and Competitive), Spike Rush, and Deathmatch. You can even set it to know your XP boost from Premium BP and Game Pass, set future dates, and tick daily challenges, day completed, and weekly challenges on and off.
